# Mathematics
Elementary math helper

Application provides help in elementary math calculations.

The most significant functionality of an application is solving linear and quadratic equations with one unknown, as well as system of linear and quadratic equations. Besides the result, user get step by step solution procedure.
  
User can draw a plot of basic quadratic function by defining function parameters. User gets information about Zero-points, function extrems and interception points between two quadratic functions. 

In geometry section, user can define known parameter values of any geometric figure or body and get all the other values that can be calculated with formula that was used. 

Users can also compare two 2-Dimensional vectors.
